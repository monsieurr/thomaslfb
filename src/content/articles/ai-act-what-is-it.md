## Introduction
The AI Act (Regulation (EU) 2024/1689) is no longer just a proposal—it is the law of the land. Having entered into force on **2 August 2024**, we are now 18 months into the implementation phase.

As of today (**February 7, 2026**), the first two waves of regulation have already hit: prohibited practices are banned, and rules for General-Purpose AI (GPAI) are active. The next hurdle? The comprehensive regime for **High-Risk AI systems**, which takes effect in less than six months.

## Risks & Current Status
The Act applies rules based on risk levels. Here is the status of each category as of early 2026:

- **Unacceptable Risk:** **[Status: BANNED]**  
  Practices deemed a clear threat to fundamental rights have been **prohibited since 2 February 2025**.  
  - *Includes:* Social scoring, biometric categorization by sensitive traits (race, religion), and untargeted scraping for facial recognition databases.  
  - *Law Enforcement:* Real-time remote biometric identification in public spaces is banned (with narrow exceptions for terrorism/missing persons).

- **High Risk:** **[Status: UPCOMING - AUG 2026]**  
  AI systems with significant impact on health, safety, or fundamental rights.  
  - *Examples:* AI used in recruitment, credit scoring, migration control, or critical infrastructure.  
  - *The "Standards" Bottleneck:* While compliance is mandatory starting **2 August 2026**, the industry is currently waiting for the final **Harmonized Standards**. If these are not finalized by CEN/CENELEC soon, the Commission may issue "Common Specifications" to fill the gap.

- **Limited Risk:** **[Status: UPCOMING - AUG 2026]**  
  Systems requiring transparency so users know they are interacting with AI.  
  - *Examples:* Chatbots, emotion recognition systems, and deepfakes.  
  - *Requirement:* Providers must ensure content is labeled and users are notified.

- **Minimal Risk:** **[Status: ACTIVE]**  
  The vast majority of AI systems (spam filters, video games) remain unregulated, though voluntary codes of conduct are encouraged.

## Actors
Accountability is shared across the supply chain. Note that **General-Purpose AI (GPAI)** providers (like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic) have been subject to their specific obligations since **August 2025**.

- **Provider:** Develops and markets the AI.
- **Deployer:** Uses the AI in a professional context (e.g., a bank using AI for loans).
- **Importer/Distributor:** Ensures the system is compliant before it enters the EU market.

## Key Concepts for High-Risk Systems
If you are preparing for the August 2026 deadline, ensure your system meets these distinct requirements:

- **Transparency:** The user knows they are interacting with a machine.
- **Explainability:** The system can provide technical details on *how* it reaches a conclusion.
- **Interpretability:** The output is presented in a way that a human can understand *why* a specific decision was made (crucial for challenging unfair decisions).

## How to Apply (The "Now" Checklist)
Steps to take immediately:

1.  **Classify Risk:** *Note:* The Commission technically missed its Feb 2, 2026 deadline to finalize the specific guidance on risk classification. For now, rely on the **draft guidance** and the text of Annex III.
2.  **Gap Analysis:** Compare your documentation against the draft Harmonized Standards.
3.  **Data Governance:** Ensure training, validation, and testing data sets meet quality criteria (free of errors and bias).
4.  **Human Oversight:** Design the UI so a human can effectively override or stop the AI ("stop button").

## Rollout Timeline: Where Are We?
| Date | Event | Status (Feb 2026) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **02 Aug 2024** | AI Act entered into force. | Completed |
| **02 Feb 2025** | Prohibitions & AI Literacy rules applied. | In Force (1 year) |
| **02 Aug 2025** | GPAI (GenAI) rules applied. | In Force (6 months) |
| **02 Aug 2026** | **High-Risk AI** & **Transparency** rules apply. | **Upcoming (<6 months)** |
| **02 Aug 2027** | High-Risk AI embedded in products (e.g., cars, medical devices). | 📅 Future |

## Next Steps
For the absolute latest on the **Harmonized Standards** delay and the **Common Specifications**, keep a close watch on the **EU AI Office** announcements.

If you are a provider of a High-Risk system, do not wait for the final standards to be published. Start your conformity assessment based on the current drafts to ensure you are ready for the **August 2 deadline**.

I will try and keep this article updated.
