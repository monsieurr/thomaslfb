Daily life can be chaotic. This short note describes my personal organization stack and the practical rules I use for managing time, tasks, and notes. It’s not a universal solution—everyone adapts tools to their preferences—but perhaps you’ll find an idea or two that works for you.

Here is what I’ve improved over the years, what I use today, and the principles I stick to.

## The four essentials

To get things done, I believe you only need four building blocks:
*   **A todo list** — to define and track what needs doing.
*   **A calendar** — to block time and track commitments.
*   **A timer** — to measure time and protect focus.
*   **Somewhere to write** — to capture learnings, ideas, and decisions.

### 1. Todo List
I’ve cycled through Todoist, Trello, and plain paper. Today, I keep a single "master" list in **Notion** and automate the recurring tasks.

However, paper remains my preferred tool for capturing complex thoughts and planning the immediate day. I find that writing by hand forces me to slow down and process information deeper than typing, which helps me clarify my thinking and retain what matters.

**What I learned:**
Keep the digital list for tasks that survive beyond today (the backlog). Use paper for the daily capture when you need to retain the information or clarify your thinking.

### 2. Timer
I’ve used Toggl, phone timers, and my watch. My tracking now depends entirely on the nature of the task.

**What I learned:**
If a task is constrained, expensive (billing), or requires deep focus, I track it precisely. If it’s creative or exploratory, tracking often adds friction, so I skip it. Only track time if you will learn something from the data or if you are being held accountable.

### 3. Calendar
**Google Calendar** is the tool I stuck with, but my usage has evolved. I don't just use it for appointments; I use it to block focused time and recurring routines.

**What I learned:**
Treat your calendar as an external memory for commitments. I also keep concise notes inside the calendar events (decisions, links, next steps) so the context stays attached to the specific time block rather than getting lost in a separate app.

### 4. Notes
I’ve migrated between Evernote, Notion, and Obsidian. I now take notes in two ways: **paper for capture** and a **synced app for storage**.

**What changed with AI:**
For years, the productivity gold standard was having a "Single Source of Truth"—one app where *everything* had to live. That has changed due to recent standards like the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

MCP acts as a universal standard that allows AI assistants to connect securely to local and remote data sources. Instead of manually moving data to one place, you can now authorize an AI agent to "read" your Notion pages, Google Calendar events, and GitHub repositories simultaneously. This means you can query your entire digital life from a single interface without needing to centralize the data manually.

**What I learned:**
Use paper to capture thoughts immediately without digital distractions. Use digital tools for long-term storage, and rely on modern AI connectors to bridge the gap between them.

## Final thoughts

My stack has gone through many phases: sometimes calendar-only, sometimes **tool heavy** with complex automations. Right now, I’ve found a balance between simplicity and structure. The tools will continue to change as my needs change, but the habits remain: capture reliably, protect your focus, and keep the signal separated from the noise.

Take what’s useful, leave the rest.
